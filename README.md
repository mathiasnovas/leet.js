### From GitHub

You can also do it the old-fashioned way:

    git clone git@github.com:mathiasnovas/leet.js.git leet

## Usage

Using `leet.js` couldn't be easier! Feed it text and it will spit out 1337 73X7ZORZ!

**Note:** Uppercase characters will "bypass" the conversion.

### As a standalone script

Run the `leet.js` file directly with whatever text you want to convert:

    ./leet.js 'i want to eat snacks and be leet!'

The result:

    I W4N7 70 347 5N4X 4ND B3 1337ZORZ!

### As a node.js module

`require` the module into your script and use the `convert` function to convert your text to 4W350M3 1337ZORZ!

```javascript
leet = require('leet');
text = leet.convert('do you know where i left my cheese?');
console.log(text); // D0 Y0U KN0W WH3R3 I 13F7 MY CH3353ZORZ?
```

### As a part of a healthy breakfast
